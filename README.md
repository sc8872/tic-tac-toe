# tic-tac-toe
Tic-tac-toe is a classic two-player game played on a grid of nine squares.  

Two-player game involves taking turns between a user and the computer. both players will be marking spaces on the grid with their designated symbols, usually 'X' and 'O'.

The game starts with an empty grid, and players alternate turns. The first player typically uses 'X' as their symbol and places it in any empty square on the grid. Then, the second player, using the symbol 'O', places their symbol in another empty square. The players continue taking turns until the game ends.

The goal of Tic-tac-toe is to create a line of three of your symbols (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the grid while preventing your opponent from doing the same. The first player to successfully create a line of their symbols is declared the winner. If all spaces on the grid are filled and no player has achieved a winning line, the game ends in a draw.

The strategy in Tic-tac-toe involves planning ahead and anticipating your opponent's moves. Players try to create winning opportunities for themselves while simultaneously blocking their opponent's chances of winning. As the game progresses, the players must make strategic decisions based on the current state of the grid and adapt their moves accordingly.

This game was built with functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board, and then tie it to the DOM, letting players click on the gameboard to place their marker.
I have also included a reset button for when the game is complete, user can play again.

Enjoy!
